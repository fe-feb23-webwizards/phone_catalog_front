# Design
The website was created based on the design that you can see at [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/FRxncC4lfyhs6og1L6FGEU/Phone-catalog-(V2)-Rounded-Style-2?node-id=0%3A1&t=j30cKBp7ptHTPPZz-0)



# Technologies
   The following technologies were used to build this project:
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux Toolkit: A library for managing and updating the application's state using events called "activities".
- Module CSS: A method of writing CSS that scopes styles to specific components or modules.
- SCSS: A CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, mixins, and nesting to CSS.
- BEM: A naming convention for CSS classes that makes code more modular and easier to read.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations.
- JavaScript: The programming language used to build the frontend logic.
- React-Slick: A library for building responsive, customizable carousels and sliders in React.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine used for building the development environment.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build a modern front-end application using React and related technologies. By using modular CSS techniques, we can write more maintainable and easier-to-read CSS. TypeScript adds type safety to our code, which makes it easier to catch bugs during development. React-Slick allows us to build responsive, customizable carousels and sliders that work well on desktop and mobile devices.
